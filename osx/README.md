Installation
============
* Copy `ProgrammerQwerty.keylayout` into `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/` *(note
  this is your home directory, not system wide, be careful on ~ character)*

Now that you've installed it, you need to enable the layout.

* Open `System Preferences`
* Goto `Keyboard`
* Click `Input Sources`
* Click `+`
* Select `Programmer Qwerty` under `Others` (or search for programmer qwerty)
* Logout and Login again.

For some reason, the newly added keyboard layout does not work without logging
out first. So please do not forget to logout/login.

Enjoy!
