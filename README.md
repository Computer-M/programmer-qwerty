Programmer Qwerty
=================

Qwerty Keyboard Layout for Programmers.

As a programmer, we use `# ( ) * & $ !` characters a lot. These characters are
normally accessed while holding the `Shift` key. With this 2-stroke
combination, it becomes tiring to type these characters and our coding session
gets ruined. Programmer Qwerty solves this!

By assigning numbers to `Shift + NUMBER` combination, the characters important
to coding can be accessed with only one stroke. So, just press `3` to type `#`
for commenting, press `8` to type `*` for pointers, press `4` to type `$` for
variable definition in many languages. If you are LISPer, the number of
keystrokes for paranthesis will greatly be reduced (nearly by half) and you
will be able to write more lambdas and maps twice as much!

Programmer Qwerty uses the standart U.S. layout and changes only the number
keys.
